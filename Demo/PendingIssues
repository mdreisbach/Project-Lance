This document lists pending issues for the Project Lance game that are to be completed by the final submission.
Last Updated: 4/15/18
---------------------
1. HUD (In game user display) spawning properly for the local multiplayer game mode. Currently only one instance spawns properly.
2. Improvements to the character select menu for multiplayer. Currently the screen displays the level to the player not selecting a character. Change this to display a waiting screen for the players waiting for the previous players to select their characters.
