This document outlines issues that were determined during the final phase of the project. These issues were resolved by the final submission of the project.
---------------------------------
1. Issue: HUD (In game user display) spawning properly for the local multiplayer game mode. Currently only one instance spawns properly.
   Resolved: HUD icons and distance text now displays correctly for all characters when multiplayer is selected.
   
2. Improvements to the character select menu for multiplayer. Currently the screen displays the level to the player not selecting a character. Change this to display a waiting screen for the players waiting for the previous players to select their characters.
   Resolved: The character select menu now displays, "Waiting for other players". While a different player is selecting their characters.
